### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can call me Mary (or Anne). I'm a Technical Writer from the Philippines.

I rekindled my love for computer science when I broke into the IT industry. 

Right now, I'm self-studying Python. I also want to familiarize myself with computer science and software development concepts. 

Learning how to code is mostly a hobby for me, but having some technical knowledge will also be helpful in my role as a Technical Writer.

This profile is a place for me to dump my digital CVs, technical writing portfolio, and Python projects.

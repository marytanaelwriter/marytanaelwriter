## Hey, welcome to my GitHub profile! âœ¨
This is where I dump my digital CVs, technical writing portfolio, and Python projects. ðŸ’»

### About me

Hi! You can call me Mary. I'm a Technical Writer from the Philippines. Currently, I'm seeking remote technical writing opportunities in IT or software companies.

### Passion in writing and technology

I've always been passionate about writing and have explored various forms, including creative writing, content writing, blogging, and copywriting. 

But after years of working as a Content Writer and Editor, I desperately wanted something new.

I did some soul searching to figure out my next steps, and I remembered my interest in computer science. I dabbled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I also love playing around with different software and applications. 

When I was setting up my blog, for example, I was more excited about learning the nitty-gritty of WordPress.org than working on my content strategy or writing my articles. 

Anyway, I've always been interested in IT and computer science, but I never felt brave enough to take the plunge. I thought I was too slow-witted for tech stuff. 

### Transitioning to tech writing

Okay. So I want to explore IT and computer scienceâ€”what next? Writing was pretty much my only marketable skill, and I sure didn't want to do a 180-degree turn and be a software developer.

During my soul searching, I somehow discovered technical writing. It was an eye-opener, to say the least. I couldn't believe there was a way to marry my love for writing *and* tech. I felt like the role was made specifically for me. I started learning more about IT and eventually landed a job in the IT industry.

Unfortunately, the role wasn't a good fit for me long-term, which is why I'm actively seeking opportunities right now.

However, finding even an entry-level role can be challenging if you don't have a technical background. To address that gap, I decided to create a tech writing portfolio and beef up my tech knowledge (both are still ongoing!). Along the way, I somehow discovered a new hobbyâ€”coding. I've *always* wanted to learn a programming language. It seems like now's as good a time as any.

Currently, I'm self-studying Python. I also want to familiarize myself with computer science, programming, and software development concepts. I've joined online communities and found new coding buddies. I've listed down all the highly recommended resources. There are *tons* out there, and I'm thrilled, but I'm taking it one step at a time.

I'm so excited about this new learning journey. 

Thanks for reading. ðŸ’•

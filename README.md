### Hey, welcome to my GitHub profile! Thanks for dropping by. âœ¨
I dump my digital CVs, technical writing portfolio, and Python projects on this page. ðŸ’»

### About me

I go by **Mary** in a professional or work setting, but my friends call me **Anne** instead. I'm a Technical Writer from the Philippines.

I've always been passionate about writing and have explored various forms, including creative writing, content writing, and copywriting. 

But after years of working as a Content Writer, I desperately wanted something new. *Anything.* I did some soul searching and remembered my interest in computer science. I dabbled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I also love playing around with different software and applications. 

When I was setting up my blog, for example, I was more excited about learning the nitty-gritty of WordPress.org than working on my content strategy or writing my articles. 

Anyway, I've always been interested in it, but I never felt brave enough to take the plunge. I thought I was too slow-witted for anything too techie.

Then I discovered technical writing... It was an eye-opener, to say the least. I felt like the role was made specifically for me. I started learning more about IT and somehow landed a job in the IT industry.

Unfortunately, the job wasn't a good fit for me long-term. So, right now, I'm actively seeking technical writing opportunities. 

However, finding an entry-level role can be challenging if you don't have a technical background. I decided to work on my tech writing portfolio and beef up my tech knowledge (both are still in the works). Along the way, I somehow discovered a new hobby--coding. I've *always* wanted to learn a programming language.

Currently, I'm self-studying Python. I also want to familiarize myself with computer science, programming, and software development concepts. I've joined online communities and found new coding buddies. I've listed down all the highly recommended resources. There are *tons* out there, and I'm thrilled, but I'm taking it one step at a time.

I'm *so* excited about this new learning journey. 

Thanks for reading. ðŸ’•

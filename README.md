So, yeah, hi!

I go by Mary in professional setups, but my friends call me Anne instead. I'm a Technical Writer from the Philippines.

I've always been passionate about writing and have explored various forms, including creative writing, content writing, and copywriting. 

But after years of working as a Content Writer, I desperately wanted something new. *Anything.* I did some soul searching and remembered my interest in computer science. I dabbled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I also love playing around with different software and applications.

Then I discovered technical writing... and somehow landed a job in the IT industry.

Unfortunately, the job wasn't a good fit for me long-term. So, right now, I'm actively seeking technical writing opportunities. 

However, finding an entry-level role can be challenging when you don't have a technical background. I decided to work on my tech writing portfolio and beef up my tech knowledge. Along the way, I somehow discovered a new hobby--coding.

I'm currently self-studying Python. I also want to familiarize myself with computer science, programming, and software development concepts. There are *tons* of resources out there, and I'm thrilled, but I'm taking it one step at a time.

I'm so excited about this new learning journey. ðŸ’•
